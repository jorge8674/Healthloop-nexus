# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

        - comment: "‚úÖ MAJOR IMPROVEMENT - CART ACCESS RESTORED: Race condition testing shows significant progress - /cart page now loads without redirecting to auth page (major improvement from previous complete blockage). Cart page is accessible and displays correctly. However, cannot test full cart functionality (add/remove items, checkout) because marketplace AddToCart is blocked by loading state. The core access issue is resolved, but full e-commerce flow testing requires marketplace loading state fix."

    - message: "Backend testing completed successfully. 11/12 tests passed (91.7% success rate). All critical user flows working correctly including authentication with demo credentials ana@example.com/password123, products API returning marketplace items, points system with proper level progression, and user management for both client and professional roles. Only video gallery endpoints not found, which appears expected as video functionality may not be implemented yet. All APIs respond correctly and JWT authentication working properly."

Tested all cart endpoints as requested: 1) Login with cliente@healthloop.com/demo123 credentials - JWT token generated successfully, 2) GET /api/cart with authentication - returns empty cart initially, 3) POST /api/cart/add with product_id and authentication - successfully adds products to cart, 4) GET /api/cart verification - confirms items added with correct quantities and totals, 5) Error handling - correctly returns 403 for unauthenticated requests and 404 for invalid product_ids. All cart functionality working perfectly with proper authentication and data persistence. Cart structure includes nested product objects with full product details, quantities, subtotals, and cart total. 100% success rate (6/6 tests passed)."

    - message: "üö® CRITICAL FRONTEND ISSUES FOUND - USER REPORT CONFIRMED! Detailed diagnostic reveals major authentication session problems: 1) LOGIN WORKS INITIALLY - User can login with cliente@healthloop.com/demo123, JWT token is stored in localStorage, redirected to dashboard successfully. 2) SESSION BREAKS IMMEDIATELY - After login, all subsequent API calls to /api/auth/me return 401 Unauthorized, causing user to lose authentication state. 3) MARKETPLACE BROKEN - No products display because authentication fails, cart functionality completely broken (401/403 errors). 4) VIDEOS PAGE EMPTY - No video content loads due to authentication issues. 5) CART PAGE NON-FUNCTIONAL - Returns empty page, no cart content loads. Backend logs confirm: Login returns 200 OK, but /api/auth/me calls return 401 Unauthorized immediately after. This is a JWT token validation/expiration issue causing complete frontend breakdown after initial login. User's report of 'frontend completely broken' is ACCURATE - while login appears to work, the entire authenticated experience fails."

    - message: "üîß JWT AUTHENTICATION FIX IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED! Root cause analysis revealed: 1) JWT tokens were expiring too quickly (30 minutes), 2) Duplicate cart endpoints causing routing conflicts, 3) Race conditions in frontend API calls. FIXES APPLIED: 1) Extended JWT token expiration to 8 hours for testing, 2) Removed duplicate cart endpoints from backend, 3) Verified JWT token storage and validation. TESTING RESULTS: ‚úÖ Login with cliente@healthloop.com/demo123 works perfectly, ‚úÖ Dashboard loads with correct user data (Ana Garc√≠a, 650 pts, Active level), ‚úÖ JWT token persists in localStorage, ‚úÖ Individual API calls (/api/auth/me, /api/cart, /api/dashboard/client) all return 200 OK, ‚úÖ Core authentication flow is functional. REMAINING ISSUE: Intermittent cart API failures during marketplace page load cause session breaks. This is a race condition where multiple simultaneous API calls sometimes fail, triggering the axios interceptor to clear tokens. The authentication fix is successful, but frontend needs optimization for concurrent API calls."

PHASE 2 (Marketplace): ‚ùå COMPLETELY BROKEN - Products API works but marketplace shows NO products due to authentication failures, user redirected to auth page. PHASE 3 (AddToCart): ‚ùå CANNOT TEST - Authentication session breaks prevent accessing marketplace functionality. PHASE 4 (Cart Flow): ‚úÖ Cart page accessible after re-login, shows 'Tu carrito est√° vac√≠o' message, but NO cart functionality available due to empty state. PHASE 5 (Checkout): ‚ùå NO checkout process available - no products in cart, no checkout buttons, no form fields. ROOT CAUSE: JWT token validation failing immediately after login success, causing complete frontend breakdown. All authenticated features (marketplace, videos, cart) are non-functional for users.

Conducted comprehensive 4-phase testing after axios interceptor changes: PHASE 1 (Authentication): ‚úÖ SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT - Login with cliente@healthloop.com/demo123 works perfectly, JWT token stored correctly, successful redirect to dashboard, user data displays (Ana Garc√≠a, 650 pts, Active level), session persistence works after page refresh. PHASE 2 (Marketplace): ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL SUCCESS - Products load correctly (5 products visible), but authentication breaks during cart operations. Add to cart shows 'Debes iniciar sesi√≥n' error despite being logged in. PHASE 3 (Cart): ‚ùå BLOCKED - Direct navigation to /cart redirects to auth page, indicating session loss. PHASE 4 (Videos): ‚ùå INACCESSIBLE - Navigation to videos triggers auth redirect. ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: While initial authentication is stable, /api/auth/me calls return 401 errors during marketplace navigation, causing axios interceptor to clear tokens and redirect to auth. Individual API tests show: /api/auth/me: 200 OK, /api/products: 200 OK, /api/cart: 200 OK when tested separately, but fail during normal app flow. The simplified interceptor improved initial auth stability but race conditions still cause session breakdown during navigation."
